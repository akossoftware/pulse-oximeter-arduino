# Connected oximeter

The purpose of this connected oximeter is to help our loved ones monitor one of the symptoms of covid-19, namely oxygen saturation (SPO2). 

The World Health Organization (WHO) said "The oxygen saturation in healthy patients of any age should be 95% or above." ([source](https://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/pulse_oximetry/who_ps_pulse_oxymetry_training_manual_en.pdf)).

In this crisis situation, the people most at risk are also those least comfortable with new technologies. That is why one of the challenges will be to create the simplest possible object: an on/off button and an OLED screen to inform the user. Nothing else. No need for a Wi-Fi connection or Bluetooth pairing, which requires mastery of the smartphone.

Simply switch on the object and place your finger on the sensor for a few seconds. If the oxygen saturation is below the set threshold then a sigfox message is sent.
